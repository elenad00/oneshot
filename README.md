# Writeaway
Writeaway is a platform to connect independent writers and editors with publishing houses across the UK for the chance to have their hobbies turned into careers.

## What is Writeaway?
Writeaway was first dreamed of in 2019 by writer and software engineer Elena Day. After haing spent almost a decade using other writing platforms to publish stories and create communities, she spotted a gap in the market for a platform that truly gave back to creatives and pioneers without adverts and paywalls, allowing writiers to have their work respected and seen by those who can give them the careers that they deserve. 

Writeaway creates relationships between writers, editors and publishers without the fear of yet another rejection email, uniting parties who would otherwise never get the chance to have their voices heard. Whether you are a hobbyist fan fiction writer, passionate sci-fi editor, or independant publishing house, there is a home for everyone at Writeaway.

## I'm a writer, how can Writeaway help me?
Writeaway allows fellow writers, editors and publishing houses to take a peek into the world that you have the power to create. Each work you add to your portolio has a limit of 5,000 words, taking the pressure off of you to complete that one first manuscript that publishing houses would usually demand. Once you click publish, your work can be seen by every editor and pblisher in our community, offering you feedback and opportunities you would never get from other platforms. We host yearly awards, quarterly writers workshops, monthly writer spotlights, and daily chances to have your work showcased, as well as 24/7 access to creating relationships with editors and publishers so you can learn from the best and develop your craft into something truly special. 

## I'm an editor, how can Writeaway help me?

With Writeaway, you have the chance to work with writers to craft their stories into something truly special. With Writeaway, you have a vast choice of stories to add your mark to and have your skills seen by our community of publishing houses and authors who may take you under their wing to create a truly powerful partnership.
